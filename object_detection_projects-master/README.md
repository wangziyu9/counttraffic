# Object Detection Projects

Here i will publish all my example projects that relate to object detection algorithms.

[**Traffic counting**](https://github.com/creotiv/object_detection_projects/tree/master/opencv_traffic_counting) - Traffic counting example based on OpencCV object detection with background subtraction.

[**Traffic capacity counting**](https://github.com/creotiv/object_detection_projects/tree/master/opencv_traffic_capacity_counting) - Traffic capacity counting example based on OpencCV.

[**Face detection in Real-Time with OpenCV and PyQt**](https://github.com/creotiv/object_detection_projects/tree/master/face_detection_with_opencv_and_pyqt) - A small demo how to use PyQt with OpenCV
